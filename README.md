This project was inspired by my exploration of various ice hockey platforms. 
While the leaderboards on these platforms were informative, I noticed a lack of detailed player shot maps, 
on-ice tendencies, and shot conversion rates. Ice Scout Pro was created to address this gap by
presenting these insights in a creative and comprehensive manner, highlighting individual player
performance and team dynamics. Ice Scout Pro aims to develop an advanced analytical tool to
enhance the evaluation of team and player performance in Division I men's and women's ice
hockey. By leveraging detailed play-by-play and game-by-game data from the 2022, 2023, and
2024 seasons, the project provides coaches, scouts, and analysts with comprehensive insights into
player behavior and team dynamics. I have developed a Shiny web application specifically for coaches and analysts to facilitate team analysis, opposition analysis, and
scouting. The application and dashboard include team and player leaderboards, player performance
profiles, which feature player shot charts, on-ice tendencies, and shot conversion rates.
